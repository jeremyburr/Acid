# Acid
Acid is a software framework (and methodology) for generating 3D models, graphics, and imagery. At its core, is the **Acid Crystal** - an interactive modular unit which can be linked and modified. While this repository uses certain tools, Acid's methodology is not specific to any language, platform, or implementation. 

Three.js is currently used. Nerdamer.js for help with math computation. Tween.js for animation.    

**It is currently in prototyping & under construction.**

## Installation and Setup 

Prototypes are built to help shape and guide initial development. To view them, start a local development server in the project root and visit any of the HTML files in the '/prototypes' directory.

## Note

The nature of this repository is very fluid as, as Acid its constantly evolving. Expect ongoing change.
