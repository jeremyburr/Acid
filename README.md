# Acid
Acid is an experimental software framework for generating graphics, 3D models, and imagery. It is currently in prototyping / under construction, and probably will be for some time. Its overall objective is to create a set of mathematics which drive interactive procedures from which art models can materialize. 

## Current Status

In its current phase of experimentation, Three.js is being used to build out a model. The approach is focusing heavily on how the geometry of hexagons can give rise to more complex shapes.
