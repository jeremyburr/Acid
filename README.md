# Acid
Acid is an emerging techincal methodology for generating 3D models and visualizing techno music. At its core, is the **Acid Crystal** - an interactive modular unit which can be linked in chains and then modified. This repository is in its experimentation and prototyping phase. It's currently using Three.js for modeling, Nerdamer.js for math computation, and Tween.js for animation tweening. However, as the fundamentals of Acid solidify and efficiency becomes a greater concern, a more low-level implementation may be explored.  Development for the music visualization component has not yet commenced.

To preview the latest development, run a local http-server at the project route, and navigate to prototypes/acid-crystal.html. To view archived prototypes, run from the /archive directory instead. *A good graphics card will likely be needed.

## Potential Future Use Cases

### 3D Printing

A natural extension of a successful 3D modeling framework would be its manifestation in the physical world. This 

### Techno Visualization

The mathematical nature of acid pairs well with ordered rhythmic genres of music. 

### Generative Art

### Video Game Models
