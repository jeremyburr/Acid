# Acid
Acid is an experimental software framework for generating graphics, 3D models, and imagery. It is currently in prototyping / under construction and will be for some time. An approach is starting to take shape: modular space units that converge at an origin. Each type of space unit has a unique set of math. Perhaps in the future, units will be linked together. Three.js is currently being used. Nerdamer.js for help with math computation. Tween.js is also used to help animate rotations.

## Installation and Setup 

Prototypes are built to 'brainstorm'. To view the prototypes built so far, start a local development server in the project root and visit any of the HTML files in the prototypes directory.
