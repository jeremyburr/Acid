# Acid
Acid is an experimental software framework for generating graphics, 3D models, and imagery. It is currently in prototyping / under construction and will be for some time. 

An approach is taking shape: modular space units - each of which converge at a point of origin. Each type of space unit is expressed by a distinct set of math. The intent is to link units together and allow them to be further modified by way of interactive procedures.

Three.js is currently being used. Nerdamer.js for help with math computation. Tween.js is also used to help animate rotations.

## Installation and Setup 

Prototypes are built to 'brainstorm'. To view prototypes, start a local development server in the project root and visit any of the HTML files in '/prototypes'.
