# Acid
Acid is an emerging techincal methodology for generating 3D models and imagery. At its core, is the **Acid Crystal** - an interactive modular unit which can be linked in chains and then modified. This repository is in its experimentation and prototyping phase. It's currently using Three.js for modeling, Nerdamer.js for math computation, and Tween.js for animation tweening. However, as the fundamentals of Acid solidify and efficiency becomes a greater concern, a more low-level implementation may be explored.  

To preview the latest development, run a local http-server at the project route, and navigate to prototypes/acid-crystal.html. To view archived prototypes, run from the /archive directory instead. *A good graphics card will likely be needed.
