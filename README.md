# Acid
Acid is an experimental software framework for generating graphics, 3D models, and imagery. It is currently in prototyping / under construction and will be for the foreseeable future.

An approach is starting to take shape: modular space units. Each type of space unit has a unique set of math. Perhaps, units can be linked together and modified by way of interactive procedures. Initial proof of concept units have been built using hexagons, hyperbolas, and a branch structure. Each prototype can be found in the 'prototypes' directory.

Three.js is currently being used in prototyping. Nerdamer.js is being used for help with math computation. Tween.js is also used to help animate rotation, in one example. 

## Installation and Setup 

To view the prototypes built so far, start a local development server in the project root and visit any of the HTML files in the prototypes directory.
