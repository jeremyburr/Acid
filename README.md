# Acid
Acid is a nascent software framework for generating 3D models, graphics, and imagery. At its core, is the **Acid Crystal** - an interactive modular unit which can be linked and modified. This repository is currently in its experimentation and prototyping phase. It's currently using Three.js for modeling, Nerdamer.js for math computation, and Tween.js for animation tweening.

To preview the latest development, run a local http-server at the project route, and navigate to prototypes/acid-crystal.html
