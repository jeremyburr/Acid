# Acid

Acid is an emerging techincal methodology for generating 3D models and imagery. 

At its core -  the **Acid Crystal** - an interactive modular unit which can be linked in chains and modified. 

This repository is in its experimentation/prototyping phase. It's currently using Three.js for modeling, Nerdamer.js for math computation, and Tween.js for animation tweening. However as the Acid develops, a more low-level implementation may be explored.

Future implementations of acid may explore music visualization, 3D printing, robotics.
