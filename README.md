# Acid

Acid is an emerging techincal methodology for generating 3D models and imagery. At its core, is the **Acid Crystal** - an interactive modular unit which can be linked in chains and then modified. This repository is in its experimentation and prototyping phase. It's currently using Three.js for modeling, Nerdamer.js for math computation, and Tween.js for animation tweening. However as the Acid develops, a more low-level implementation may be explored as efficiency becomes a greater concern,

Future offshoots of acid will likely be exploring music visualization, 3D printing, robotics.
