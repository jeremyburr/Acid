# Acid
Acid is an experimental software framework for generating graphics, 3D models, and imagery. It is currently in prototyping / under construction, and probably will be for some time. Its overall objective is to create a set of mathematics for interactive procedures that drive the creation of art.

In its current phase of experimentation, Three.js is being used to build out various models. The approach started with hexagons and is now also beginning to use hyperbolas.
