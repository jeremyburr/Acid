# Acid
Acid is an experimental software framework for generating graphics, 3D models, and imagery. It is currently in prototyping / under construction and will be for the foreseeable future. An approach is starting to take shape: modular space units. Each type of space unit has a unique set of math. Perhaps, units can be linked together.

Three.js is currently being used. Nerdamer.js for help with math computation. Tween.js is also used to help animate rotations.

## Installation and Setup 

Prototypes are built to 'brainstorm'. To view the prototypes built so far, start a local development server in the project root and visit any of the HTML files in the prototypes directory.
